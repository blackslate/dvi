Start with an empty set of images. 
Choose a verb at random
Remove all images that illustrate the verbs for the chosen image from the distractor set
Check what verbs are missing from the distractor set
Choose the first image from the missing verbs lists that does not use any of the verbs of the chosen image
This will give 4 distractors

Create a list of 5 distractors, none of which uses two verbs
From this list, choose 3 that do not match the current image
Ensure that the same verb does not appear in the next turn
Switch out the image that was cued
Cue any of the four current images

abcd
ebcd
eacd

Add a new (solo) distractor
If a double distractor is added, then it must be chosen immediately

Easier to change all 
If any one is double, ensure that the extra verb is not chosen.
  This means ignoring any upcoming doubles



Choose a verb
Choose the next example of this verb
Use the list of verbs for this example as the exclusion list
- Skip any verbs in the exclusion list
- Skip any images for other verbs that contain an item in the exclusion list

Result: the distractor images may share verbs, but none will share verbs with the correct answer

Even simpler: only the cued verb should be excluded from distractors
